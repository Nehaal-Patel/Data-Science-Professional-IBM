## Tools of Data Science: 
I created a Jupyter Notebook using IBM Watson Studio using Python. I included a combination of markdown and code cells. I used the Markdown cheatsheet to help you determine the appropriate syntax to style my markdown, And met the following requirements:   
    
- Cell 1 (rendered as Markdown): The title should be "My Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio", in H1 header styling. The title does not need to be centered.
- Cell 2 (rendered as Markdown): Include your name, in bold characters. In the line below your name, write your current or desired occupation in regular font.
- Cell 3 (rendered as Markdown): In italic formatting, write one or two sentences about why you are interested in data science. For example, you can start your first sentence with "I am interested in data science because ...".
- Cell 4 (rendered as Markdown): In H3 header styling, explain in a short sentence what your code is supposed to do in Cell 5.
- Cell 5 (code cell): Your code, as described in Cell 4. It must be executed and must display an output. Try to keep the code simple (it can even be "1 + 1").
- Cell 6 (rendered as Markdown): Using Markdown or HTML, this cell must include at least 3 of the following: horizontal rule, bulleted list, numbered list, tables, hyperlinks, images, code/syntax highlighting, blocked quotes, strikethrough.

##  Databases and SQL for Data Science:  

As a hands-on Data Science Assignment, I worked on a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal. I answered the questions  asked that           helped me understand the data just like a data scientist would. File: DB0201EN-Week4-2-2-PeerAssign-v5-py.ipynb 

## Data Analysis with Python 

In this assignment, I worked at a real estate investment trust data. The trust wanted to start investing in Residential real estate. I was  tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features.I  analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors and so on. A template notebook was provided in the lab; I had to complete the ten questions asked. I used Watson Studio to perform the analysis. File: Data_Analysis_with_Python_Final_Project.ipynb

## Data Visualization with Python

In this Assignment, I demonstrated the data visualization skills I learned. I generated two visualization plots. The first one was a plot to summarize the results of a survey that was conducted to gauge an audience interest in different data science topics. The second plot was a Choropleth map of the crime rate in San Francisco. File:
