As a hands-on Data Science Assignment, I worked on a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal. I answered the questions  asked that           helped me understand the data just like a data scientist would. File: DB0201EN-Week4-2-2-PeerAssign-v5-py.ipynb 

## Data Analysis with Python 

In this assignment, I worked at a real estate investment trust data. The trust wanted to start investing in Residential real estate. I was  tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features.I  analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors and so on. A template notebook was provided in the lab; I had to complete the ten questions asked. I used Watson Studio to perform the analysis. File: Data_Analysis_with_Python_Final_Project.ipynb
